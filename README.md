                                                        DAY-1 Topics Covered :

1.Hoisting in java script. Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top

2.Operators in java script.

Arithmetic operators are symbols that perform mathematical operations on numbers.

+ Addition

- Subtraction

*Multiplication

/Division

% Remainder

Comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean value of true or false.

== Checks if two operands are equal

!= Checks if two operands are not equal

<: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand

: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand

<= Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand

= Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand


                                                               Day 2 Topics Covered :

1.The Increment Operator (++)
 The increment operator (++) adds 1 from the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the increment.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the increment.

2.The Decrement Operator (--)
 The decrement operator (--) subtracts 1 to the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the decrement.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the decrement.
 
3.Logical Operators
 a. && and
 b. || or
 c. ! not

                                                             Day 3 Topics Covered :

1.Decision Making
Decision Making in programming is needed to make the logical decision for doing some operation.

if statement: It is used if some statement has to be executed based on single condition. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e. if a certain condition is true then the block of statement is executed otherwise not.

if-else statement: It is used when some set of code has to be executed based on some given conditions otherwise another set of code has to be executed. The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false then else block executed. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

Switch-Statement: It is used when multiple condition has to be evaluated based on single variable expression.

2.prompt() method
The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input.


                                                                Day 4 Topics Covered :

JavaScript loops is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

1.for - loops through a block of code a number of times
Syntax-
for (statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3)
{ code here...}

2.for/in - The JavaScript for…in loop iterates over the properties of an object. It allows you to access each key or property name of an object.
Syntax-
for (key in object) {    // Code}

3.While - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true or the while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. In JavaScript, this loop evaluates the condition before each iteration and continues running as long as the condition remains true.
Syntax-
while (condition) {    Code block to be executed}

4.Do/while - A do…while loop in JavaScript is a control structure where the code executes repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. It’s similar to a repeating if statement. One key difference is that a do…while loop guarantees that the code block will execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is met initially or not.
Syntax:

do {
    // Statements
}
while(conditions)
